# View Server Resources
A Minecraft mod that allows you to preview server resource pack URLs before downloading them

![New Server Resource Pack Screen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edf3b358-0bad-4237-b4fe-910f931ca729)

This allows you to:
1. See what you're actually downloading and where it is from
2. Whitelist specific pack URLs or sites
3. Decide for each installed server resource pack individually (Normally, the client would accept all server packs even if you accepted only one)
